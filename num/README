NUMERICAL ANALYSIS PROJECT 1
Calculate f(x) = 0 using several methods

...in Python

num.py--how it works:
	This contains several functions. The most important are newtons, secant, fixedpoint, and bisection. These calculate the answer (within a tolerance), and the error these functions have as they iterate.
	They all return a tuple:
		The first element is the result of the iteration
		The second element is a triple of lists containing the errors during each iteration. There are 3 error functions, so there are 3 lists of errors.

graph.py--how it works:
	This uses the matplotlib to create the pretty graphs. It contains a function, plotErrors, that will generate a PNG of the graph of the different error functions.
	plotErrors takes 4 parameters:
		The 3 list of errors from the 3 error functions
		The "label" of the graph (newton, secant, etc). This will be used to label the graph and the filename
